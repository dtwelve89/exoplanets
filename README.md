## Exoplanet Data Explorer

Noodle.ai assignment by Danny Nguyen

### Summary:

Using a dataset from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory, this application allows the reader to view a graphical distribution of values. The client is able to select different features for each axis and see the corresponding data.

### Technologies Used:

JavaScript, React, d3, HTML5 and CSS3.

### Run Instructions:

- yarn install
- yarn start

### Approach

- First I needed to understand how d3 worked, so I spent quite some time reading and researching before I actually began to code.
- After I felt comfortable, I started with loading the data and understanding the returned format.
- Once I was able to load the data successfully in its proper format, I began to filter out the non-numeric fields.
- Then, I had to decide whether to use class or functional components for what I needed using React. After some research, I had my blueprint and created the neccessary components.
- It was my first time using d3 so I looked at a lot of examples. Eventually, I was able to implement the scatterplot I needed to render the dataset.
- Finally, I added some styling so the application would like presentable.

### Todo

- I did not get to reach the last portion with the binned histogram. I spent some time reading up on the topic and looking at some examples, but it got late and I decided to call it a night for some rest. However, I'm still curious and intend to revisit this topic soon. Thank you for your time viewing the outcome.
